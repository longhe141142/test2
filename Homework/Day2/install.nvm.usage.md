  * After, run this in terminal:
  ```curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh | bash ```
  * **Important**... - DO NOT forget to Restart your terminal **OR** use command source ```~/.nvm/nvm.sh``` _(this will refresh the available commands in your system path)._
  * In the terminal, use command nvm --version and you should see the version.
